ES6 plugins
===========

Initially I want to maintain my blog in pure js5 and css (scss) technique stack because I believe ES6 and other frameworks bring too much complexities into the project and a personal blog is itself too simple to use the advanced technology. 

After applying some media resources and adding support of different devices with Javascript manipulation for users, I found the problem becomes more and more complex. Hence I decided to update the blog by being back to Webpack + ES6 technology.

To fully utilize the modern front end technology, support of virtual dom and template engine for MVVC is added. Because I am considering to show some stunning 3d demos through serverless webapplication. Webpack and require are temporially used for dependencies management because when media mime resources introduced, asynchronouse event becomes hard to predict event you use promise directly.
